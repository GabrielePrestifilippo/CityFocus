                <strong>City Focus</strong> City Focus is a web application, winner of the MYGEOSS third call for
                innovative Apps, launched by the European Commission
                (http://digitalearthlab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/mygeoss/results3.cfm). The call focused on developing
                applications of European relevance able to provide users with quantitative or qualitative information on
                the changing environment, taking into account broad environmental or social themes across geographic
                scales, stressing the use of openly available or crowd-generated data in different domains addressing
                citizens’ needs.

                City Focus is a web-based interactive 2D and 3D GIS application to find the best place in a city to
                live, or to pass shorter staying. The user can select among different criteria and decide their
                importance by assigning weights to each of them. The application provides thematic maps displaying
                insights on the places which better fit the user’s preferences. The resulting map is computed through
                map algebra upon a cascade of pre-built raster maps. Users are guided in the requests through a
                predefined list of criteria including: air quality, precipitation, terrain morphology (e.g. slope, solar
                exposure, etc.), temperature, proximity to urban facilities (e.g. schools, transportations, sports
                fields, cultural attractions, healthcare centers, parking lots, shops, etc.), presence of public spaces,
                land use characteristics (e.g. commercial areas, residential areas, etc.), population density, traffic
                or internet connection.
